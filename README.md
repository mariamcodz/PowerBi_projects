Sugar Free Feb Campaign Outline
In May 2017, 2,000 people attempted to cut down on sugar as part of Cancer Research UK’s 
Sugar Free February campaign, they were asked to raise sponsorship as part of the 
challenge. 

We need a dashboard so the Campaign Manager can see how the campaign is 
performing. As part of the sign-up process, we collect some demographic information, along 
with social and email interaction and the sponsorship money raised.

Key Aim of the task 

• Create an interaction dashboard in Power BI, which shows the key metrics need to 
track this campaign. 
The data for the presentation has been attached. You will find 5 sheets in the excel 
spreadsheet one with the definitions for the data used and the other 4 is the datasets used.
